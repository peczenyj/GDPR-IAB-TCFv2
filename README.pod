=head1 ACRONYMS

L<GDPR|https://gdpr-info.eu/>: General Data Protection Regulation

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=head2 Parse

The Parse method will decode and validate a base64 encoded version of the tcf v2 string.

Will return a C<GDPR::IAB::TCFv2> immutable object that allow easy access to different properties.

Will die if can't decode the string.

    use GDPR::IAB::TCFv2;

    my $consent = GDPR::IAB::TCFv2->Parse(
        'CLcVDxRMWfGmWAVAHCENAXCkAKDAADnAABRgA5mdfCKZuYJez-NQm0TBMYA4oCAAGQYIAAAAAAEAIAEgAA.argAC0gAAAAAAAAAAAA'
    );

=head1 METHODS

=head2 version

Version number of the encoding format. The value is 2 for this format.

=head2 created

Epoch time format when TC String was created in numeric format. You can easily parse with L<DateTime> if needed.

=head2 last_updated

Epoch time format when TC String was last updated in numeric format. You can easily parse with L<DateTime> if needed.

=head2 cmp_id

Consent Management Platform ID that last updated the TC String. Is a unique ID will be assigned to each Consent Management Platform.

=head2 cmp_version

Consent Management Platform version of the CMP that last updated this TC String.
Each change to a CMP should increment their internally assigned version number as a record of which version the user gave consent and transparency was established.

=head2 consent_screen

CMP Screen number at which consent was given for a user with the CMP that last updated this TC String.
The number is a CMP internal designation and is CmpVersion specific. The number is used for identifying on which screen a user gave consent as a record.

=head2 consent_language

Two-letter L<ISO 639-1|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1> language code in which the CMP UI was presented.

=head2 vendor_list_version

Number corresponds to L<GVL|https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/GDPR-Transparency-and-Consent-Framework/blob/master/TCFv2/IAB%20Tech%20Lab%20-%20Consent%20string%20and%20vendor%20list%20formats%20v2.md#the-global-vendor-list> vendorListVersion.
Version of the GVL used to create this TC String.

=head2 policy_version

Version of policy used within L<GVL|https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/GDPR-Transparency-and-Consent-Framework/blob/master/TCFv2/IAB%20Tech%20Lab%20-%20Consent%20string%20and%20vendor%20list%20formats%20v2.md#the-global-vendor-list>.

From the corresponding field in the GVL that was used for obtaining consent.

=head2 is_service_specific

This field must always have the value of 1. When a Vendor encounters a TC String with C<is_service_specific=0> then it is considered invalid.

=head2 use_non_standard_stacks

If true, CMP used non-IAB standard texts during consent gathering.

Setting this to 1 signals to Vendors that a private CMP has modified standard Stack descriptions and/or their translations and/or that a CMP has modified or supplemented standard Illustrations and/or their translations as allowed by the policy..

=head2 is_special_feature_opt_in

If true means Opt in.

The TCF L<Policies|https://iabeurope.eu/iab-europe-transparency-consent-framework-policies/> designates certain Features as "special" which means a CMP must afford the user a means to opt in to their use. These "Special Features" are published and numerically identified in the L<Global Vendor List separately|https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/GDPR-Transparency-and-Consent-Framework/blob/master/TCFv2/IAB%20Tech%20Lab%20-%20Consent%20string%20and%20vendor%20list%20formats%20v2.md#the-global-vendor-list> from normal Features.

See also: L<GDPR::IAB::TCFv2::Constants::SpecialFeature>.

=head2 is_purpose_consent_allowed

If true means Consent.

The user's consent value for each Purpose established on the legal basis of consent.

=head2 is_purpose_legitimate_interest_allowed

The user's consent value for each Purpose established on the legal basis of legitimate interest.

    my $ok = $instance->is_purpose_legitimate_interest_allowed(1);

=head2 purpose_one_treatment

CMPs can use the PublisherCC field to indicate the legal jurisdiction the publisher is under to help vendors determine whether the vendor needs consent for Purpose 1.

Returns true if Purpose 1 was NOT disclosed at all.

Returns false if Purpose 1 was disclosed commonly as consent as expected by the L<Policies|https://iabeurope.eu/iab-europe-transparency-consent-framework-policies/>.

=head2 publisher_country_code

Two-letter L<ISO 639-1|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1> language code of the country that determines legislation of reference. 
Commonly, this corresponds to the country in which the publisher's business entity is established.

=head2 max_vendor_id_consent

The maximum Vendor ID that is represented in the following bit field or range encoding.

Because this section can be a variable length, this indicates the last ID of the section so that a decoder will know when it has reached the end.

=head2 vendor_consent

If true, vendor has consent.

The consent value for each Vendor ID.

    my $ok = $instance->vendor_consent(284); # if true, consent ok for Weborama (vendor id 284).

=head2 max_vendor_id_legitimate_interest

The maximum Vendor ID that is represented in the following bit field or range encoding.

Because this section can be a variable length, this indicates the last ID of the section so that a decoder will know when it has reached the end.
